#  MyBnB - progressive web app (PWA)

**MyBnB** is my type of AirBnB app adapted for Swiss area. It was my final project as a Full-Stack Web Developer at [Propulsion Academy](https://propulsion.academy/) to demonstrate all technologies I learned at Academy.

**MyBnB** is realized as a progressive web app (PWA) with a complete back-end and front-end solution. Since it is **PWA**, it is completely **optimized only for mobile phones**.



Technologies I used in this project:

**Backend**:

 * Python
 * [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
 * [Django Rest](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
 * [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)



**Frontend**:

* HTML5 & CSS
* JavaScript

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [OnsenUI](https://onsen.io/)



**Other**:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

* [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)




Project is deployed at AWS and can be access at:

Because of the size of the project and time limit, project is not 100% functional but it demonstrates acquired knowledge. **For the testing purposes, only data in Lucerne canton is populated**.
